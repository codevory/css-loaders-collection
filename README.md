# 🚀 CSS Loader Collection by Shahijahan

A beautifully crafted set of **pure CSS loaders** created from scratch to demonstrate animation mastery and frontend UI creativity. This collection includes spinners, pulsing effects, progress bars, bouncing dots, and square animations — all responsive and lightweight.

## 🧩 Loaders Included

### 🔄 Spinner Loader
A classic circular spinner using `border-top` rotation animation.

### ⚙️ Rabia Spinner
A personalized spinner using `border-left` to create a unique rotating effect. Inspired by real-world loading indicators with a custom twist.

### 💓 Pulse Loader
A smooth pulsing dot that mimics heartbeat-like animation using `transform: scale()`.

### 🟣 Dots Loader
Four bouncing dots in a sequence, great for chat or background loading screens.

### 📊 Progress Bar
A horizontally expanding progress bar that fills over time using CSS keyframes.

### 🟧 Reversing Progress Bars
Two styles of reversing fill animations to simulate upload/download activity.
